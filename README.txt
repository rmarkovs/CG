Instructions
----------------------------
The way I ran this API was through eclipse. Download the project file and then simply press run. 
Alternatively, this can also be compiled through the command line and deployed on a web server.

If I had more time
-----------------------------
If I had more time I would have tested this API more. I would have also had setter methods for each attribute and would have added
errors as opposed to a default value being assigned. I would have also added more attributes to the trainers, more options for the type attribute,
and stored the trainer type as an arrayList of enumerated types as opposed to having only one be assigned for each trainer, as a trainer
may specialize in more than one thing. I would have also tried to create a client, but having never built a full API from scratch before
(rather the xml and servlet components) I unfortunately ran out of time.
